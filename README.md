# 🌐 Network Traffic Analysis Project

Welcome to my Network Traffic Analysis Projects repository! This project showcases my expertise in capturing, filtering, and analyzing network traffic using powerful tools like `tcpdump` and `Wireshark`. These skills are essential for monitoring and securing network environments. 🛡️

## 🛠️ Project Breakdown

In this project, I delve into two critical aspects of network traffic analysis. Here’s what you’ll find:

### 1. 🛑 Network Traffic Analysis with `tcpdump`

- **Objective**: Capture network traffic from a Linux machine's network interface, save it as a `.pcap` file, and filter and analyze the captured data.
- **Tools Used**: `tcpdump`
- **Highlights**:
  - Captured live network traffic to monitor data packets in real-time.
  - Saved traffic logs to a `.pcap` file for detailed offline analysis.
  - Applied filters to hone in on specific types of traffic, such as HTTP requests or ICMP packets, making the data more manageable and insightful.
  
  **Why it Matters**: Understanding how to efficiently capture and filter traffic is crucial for identifying potential security threats, diagnosing network issues, and ensuring smooth network operations. 🚦

### 2. 🕵️‍♂️ Network Traffic Analysis with Filters in `Wireshark`

- **Objective**: Investigate network traffic by analyzing a packet capture file containing data related to a user connecting to a website, using `Wireshark`.
- **Tools Used**: `Wireshark`
- **Highlights**:
  - Loaded a network packet capture file into `Wireshark` for in-depth analysis.
  - Used `Wireshark`’s powerful filtering capabilities to isolate traffic related to specific IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
  - Identified and examined key events, such as DNS queries and HTTP requests, to reconstruct the user’s interaction with the website.
  
  **Why it Matters**: `Wireshark` is a go-to tool for deep packet inspection. Mastering its filters allows SOC analysts to quickly identify suspicious activities and troubleshoot network problems effectively. 🔍

## 🧠 Why These Projects Matter

These projects are essential for any SOC analyst or network security professional. By mastering tools like `tcpdump` and `Wireshark`, you gain the ability to monitor network traffic, identify anomalies, and respond to potential threats in real-time. 🌐
